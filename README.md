**multiAgentAImodelProject ðŸš€**

A Python framework for building and orchestrating multi-agent AI systems featuring debate, feedback, judgment, memory, logging, and user input handling via LLM-powered agents

ðŸ§© Project Overview


This project demonstrates how to coordinate multiple specialized agentsâ€”such as debaters, judges, 
and memory managersâ€”using language models to collaboratively process and refine user input before delivering a final result.

Core Components

agents.py â€“ Defines classes for various agent types (e.g., DebateAgent, JudgeAgent).

main.py â€“ Orchestrates the multi-agent workflow, handling user prompts and routing through debate, judge, and feedback cycles.

memory.py â€“ Agent memory management (notes, conversation history, etc.).

feedback.py â€“ Facilitates iterative feedback loops between agents.

judge.py â€“ Implements logic for comparing and selecting from multiple agent responses.

user_input.py â€“ Standardizes and pre-processes incoming requests from users.

logger.py â€“ Utility for structured logging across agents and sessions.

__Install dependencies:__

pip install -r requirements.txt

**__ðŸš¦ Usage__**

Run the main orchestrator ---->> python main.py

This will prompt for user input, route it through the multi-agent pipeline (debate, judgment, feedback), and output the final response.

Customize behavior by:

 Editing agent behaviors in agents.py
 
 Adding memory features using memory.py
 
 Tuning feedback and judge thresholds in feedback.py and judge.py

 **ðŸ§  How It Works**
1.  UserInputAgent sanitizes and formats incoming prompts.
2.  DebateAgent proposes multiple candidate responses.
3.  Responses are logged in debate_log.txt via Logger.
4.  JudgeAgent evaluates candidates and selects the best one.
5.  Optional FeedbackAgent refines the output further.
6.  MemoryAgent updates historical context for future interactions.

 **ðŸ”§ Extensibility**
 1.  Add new agents: Extend base agent class in agents.py.
 
 2.  Enhance memory: Build sophisticated context storage with memory.py.

 3.  Improve evaluation: Replace or augment judge.py with scoring metrics (e.g., semantic similarity, external APIs).
